# Week 6 – Consent Protocol (COMP2850)

**Researcher:** Karan Chugani  
**Module:** COMP2850 – Human–Computer Interaction  
**Date:** 2025-11-24  
**Contact email:** jfdg9288@leeds.ac.uk  

## 1. Purpose

I’m working on a task manager as part of COMP2850.  
This interview is to understand how people manage tasks and what problems they face, so I can design more inclusive features.

## 2. What you’ll do

- A short, ~5–10 minute conversation about how you manage tasks (coursework, life admin, etc.).
- I’ll take written notes (no recording).
- There are no right or wrong answers – I’m interested in your experiences.

## 3. Data and privacy

- I will **not** record your name, email, username, or student ID in my notes.
- I will use a **pseudonym** (e.g. P1, P2) instead of your name.
- Notes are stored only in my **local Git repository** on my laptop for this module.
- Notes will be used only for COMP2850 coursework and will not be shared publicly.

## 4. Your rights

- Participation is **voluntary**.
- You can **stop at any time** without giving a reason.
- You can ask me to **delete your notes** at any point; I will remove your pseudonym and any identifiable details.
- You can skip any question you don’t want to answer.

## 5. Risks and benefits

- Risks: minimal; some people may feel mild discomfort talking about stress or deadlines.
- Benefits: your feedback may help improve an inclusive task manager design for students.

## 6. Consent script (read aloud)

Before starting, I will say:

> “I’m doing a small research activity for my HCI module about how students manage tasks.  
> I’ll ask you a few questions about how you use to-do lists or planners.  
> I’ll use a pseudonym instead of your name and I won’t record any personal identifiers.  
> You can stop at any time or ask me to delete your notes.  
> Is that okay, and do you consent to take part?”

If they say **yes**, I’ll note the time below.
